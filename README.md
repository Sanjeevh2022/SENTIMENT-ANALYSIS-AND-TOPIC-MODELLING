# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-AND-TOPIC-MODELLING
Quest 2 is a virtual reality (VR) headset developed by Reality Labs, a division of Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms). It was unveiled on September 16, 2020 and released on October 13 as the Oculus Quest 2. The Quest 2 received mostly positive reviews as an incremental update to the Quest, but some of its changes faced criticism, including its stock head strap, reduced interpupillary distance (IPD) options, and a new requirement for users to log in with a Facebook account to use the headset and Oculus services. In this project, I have attempted to find out if the reviews of Oculus Quest 2 have indeed captured the salient points mentioned above. In this project, I have looked at the reviews of the Oculus Quest 2 from Word Level and Sentence Level perspectives using a Lexicon-based approach. I have combined three major lexicons Bing, AFINN, and NRC, and combined them to get an Average Sentiment Score.
As part of the analyses, I have used GloVe to calculate the Cosine similarity between words associated with 'Oculus', and then t-SNE to visualize the closeness and similarity of the words. I have used lexicon-based approaches (BING, AFINN, NRC) to analyze the sentiment of the reviews. Latent Dirichlet Allocation method of Topic Modelling, and Co-occurrences within 3-words distance to identify problem areas like 'battery-life', 'head-strap', 'screen-door effect', etc.
