# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-AND-TOPIC-MODELLING
Quest 2 is a virtual reality (VR) headset developed by Reality Labs, a division of Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms). In this project, I have looked at the reviews of the Oculus Quest 2 from Word Level and Sentence Level perspectives using a Lexicon-based approach. I have combined three major lexicons Bing, AFINN, and NRC, and combined them to get an Average Sentiment Score.
As part of the analysis, I have used GloVe to calculate the Cosine similarity between words associated with 'Oculus', and then t-SNE to visualize the closeness and similarity of the words. I have used lexicon-based approaches (BING, AFINN, NRC) to analyze the sentiment of the reviews. Latent Dirichlet Allocation method of Topic Modelling, and Co-occurrences within a 3-word distance to identify problem areas like 'battery-life', 'head-strap', 'screen-door effect', etc were also used.
